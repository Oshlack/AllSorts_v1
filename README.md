Welcome to the All Sorts Readme!

AllSorts is a B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Classifier, aiming to classify ALL into its various sub-types using RNA-Seq data to observe gene expression profiles. 

The tool is an R package which includes vignettes for you to peruse at your own pace which will explain how to use the classifier.

#Installation
